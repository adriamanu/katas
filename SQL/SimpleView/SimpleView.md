For this challenge you need to create a VIEW.<br>
This VIEW is used by a sales store to give out vouches to members who have spent over $1000 in departments that have brought in more than $10000 total ordered by the members id.<br>
The VIEW must be called members_approved_for_voucher then you must create a SELECT query using the view.
